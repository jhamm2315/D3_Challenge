### Background
Welcome to the Newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates retrieved from census.gov. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Proect Goal
Create an interactive scatterplot of the data in which:
- x-axis and y-axis can be selected to show different data
- Incorporate tooltips so each data point shows the data when moused over
- Looks visually appealing and professional (axis labels, ticks, etc.)

##### Note: 
To view final project - You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser.
